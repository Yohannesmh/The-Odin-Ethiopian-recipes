        <p>This is the staple bread of Ethiopia. It is traditionally made with teff, 
            a very finely milled millet flour. Regular millet flour from a health 
            food store will work fine. Use this bread to sop up the flavors of spicy stews.</p>
        <p>njera is an Ethiopian flatbread made from fermented Teff flour sourdough.
             Injera also known as Ethiopian bread is thinner than a pancake and has a 
             slight spongy texture. On one side, Injera has a honeycombed looking pattern 
             intended to absorb the sauces and stews it is served with.</p>
        <p>Injera is the staple food in Ethiopia making it the essential component of most
             Ethiopian dishes. Dining and sharing Ethiopian food from a common plate of

             <ol>
                    <li>Add all ingredients into a mixing bowl</li>
                    <li>Mix and knead the dough for about 7 minutes</li>
                    <li>Top the batter with another 4 cups of water and leave it unmixed</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and leave it in a normal temperature room for 4 days</li>
                    <li>On the 4th day, you will find the dough separated from the extra water</li>
                    <li>Replace the water slowly without mixing, cover and leave it for another day</li>
                    <li>Get rid of the extra water leaving about a cup and mix it well</li>
                    <li>In a small pot, boil a large cup of water</li>
                    <li>Reduce the heat and add half cup of the batter and quickly mix it to avoid lumps forming</li>
                    <li>Simmer for few minutes and let it cool down for at least 5 minutes</li>
                    <li>Add the cooked batter into your bowl and mix it well making sure there are no lumps left</li>
                    <li>Cover and let the mixture seat for another 12 hours</li>
                    <li>Adjust the consistency by adding around a cup of cold water making sure you end up with a batter thinner than pancake one</li>
                    <li>Use a measuring jug to add around 300ml of the batter to make an injera</li>
                    <li>Heat you Mitad (pan like Injera grill) to 350 degrees</li>
                    <li>Start from outside and pour a jug of the batter into the Mitad forming a large round injera</li>
                    <li>Let it cook uncovered for about 15 seconds until the porous start forming</li>
                    <li>Cover with the lead and let it cook for about 2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Use a flat plate to take out the Injera and let it cool down</li>
                    <li>Server on flat plate and topped with sauces or stews</li>
